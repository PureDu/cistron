= Quick Start Guide =

First, you should [Installation install] Cistron if you haven't done so already.

The file `Main.cpp`, which is included in the project distribution, serves both as a tutorial and an introduction to the framework. You should start by working your way through the file frop top to bottom. It explains all the concepts and functionality as you pass through it. You can also read the tutorial directly in your browser on the following page:
[http://code.google.com/p/cistron/source/browse/trunk/Main.cpp]

After reading the tutorial, you should have a good idea of how to use the framework, and implement it in your own project. However, some of the more subtle possibilities and uses of Cistron were not discussed in the short example. If you want to go into more detail on how to optimize your use of Cistron, you can read the pages in the reference guide. However, this is not necessary to use Cistron.
