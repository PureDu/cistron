Cistron is platform-independent and depends only on the STL for its implementation. This means that every project can use Cistron by just compiling the three source files (`ObjectManager.cpp`, `Object.cpp` and `Component.cpp`) and linking your project to them.

In Visual Studio, it is the easiest to copy the code to your project directory and add them to your project in Visual Studio.
