= How To Install =

First, you should download the latest version of Cistron from the Downloads section.

Cistron is platform-independent and depends only on the STL for its implementation. This means that every project can use Cistron by just compiling the three source files (`ObjectManager.cpp`, `Object.cpp` and `Component.cpp`) and linking your project to them. To use the framework, just include `Cistron.h`. Note that the framework is made available in its own namespace `Cistron`.

In Visual Studio, it is the easiest to copy all the files (except for `Main.cpp`!)to your project directory and add them to your own project in Visual Studio.
